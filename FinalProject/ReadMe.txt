#Project Overview

#This was a final project for a software development course. The goal of my final project was to create a more effective way to search through Steam, the digital 
#distribution service, that would allow users personalized and specific results. I found the Steam search engine to be lacking many features that are common 
#in larger e-commerce stores, such as the ability to sort by price, genre, tags that Steam had already created, and a few other options. In this project, I utilized
#Object-Oriented Programming, LINQ statements, a PDF generator, and some file parsing. 

#How the project worked

#The project would open up the CSV that was used as a modified version of the Steam database (it was the most effective way to simulate the Steam database within the 
#time period I was working with) and prompt the user to search through the database. The user would then input the option that they would like to use for searching.
#The options for the user are to search by the Title, Genre, Price, Tags, or user-recommended games. Each option has a unique set of LINQ statements to search through
#the database with, some being more complex than others. The user would then be prompted to save their results to a PDF, which would generate a table containing the 
#game titles and their respective prices. This feature was very interesting to learn, as it required some researching into impementing .NET components that I had not
#been exposed to during the course.
